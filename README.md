#### **First Impressions**:

- The top **five artists** were responsible for **approximately 25%** of the **total listening time this year to date.**
- In **contrast**, the **top five most-listened tracks** accounted for **only 2%** of the **overall listening time year to date.**
- The dataframe includes **37 weeks** of listening history; however, **only two or three weeks** in the **weekly top chart** are **necessary** to **rank tracks consistently.**

---

#### **Initial conclusion**: 

- **More reliable methods are necessary** to identify the "*most consistently played*" tracks rather than just counting their appearances in weekly or monthly top charts.
